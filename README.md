## open-sourced the SMPCTool, and yes it builds & works as intended.
yes its the actual source, straight from the tool on nexusmods.com. i like to know what im running, and im sure you do too.

## what can be done with this?
this creates the opportunity for other modders to enchance this tool, and possbily make something that will change SMPC Modding forever.
